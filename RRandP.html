        <br> -Routers use IP addresses to transfer data along direct connections between your computer and the internet.
        <br>
        <br> -Redundancy is when the direct connections between your computer and the internet are down and the router must find another route or a more unpredictable path to the destination depending on network conditions. This is called working dynamically.
        <br>
        <br> -Packets are the pieces or segments of information that make up a larger message. Data, computer requests, and messages are sent in the form of packets. Packets contain anywehre between 64 and 1500 bytes each.
