        -Many people confuse the internet and the WWW but the internet is actually just the layers and paths that lead a computer to the WWW. It is made of many protocols that are designed to help the computer work at a large scale where billions of devices can communicate with one another.
        <br>
        <br>
        -Package requests are transfered through the internet to collect data from the WWW to send back through the internet to the device that requested the data.
