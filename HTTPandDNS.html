        -HTTP are the requests sent by computers over the internet in the form of packets. These requests are then sent to databases to recieve information that is then sent back to your computer over the internet.

        -DNS are a system of servers that keep track of IP addresses associated with each domain name. Domain names are .org, .com, .edu, and so on. When you send a request to a certain website, the DNS filters through the domain names and sends back a website.
